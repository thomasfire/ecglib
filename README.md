# ecglib

Structural rework of the original brandicph/ECGscanner-C. Didn't changed algorithms, though

For algorithms please refer to https://github.com/brandicph/ECGscanner-C

I just restructured it to make it possible to use in small [ECG server](https://github.com/thomasfire/ecg_server), so codestyle may vary.

Actually, code is quite messy, so I didn't reworked its logic.
